# What's the big deal with "seamless masks"?

The RESHDP texture pack solves the **seam issue** that always comes up when any kind of filtering or upscaling is applied to the game's **mask textures**. 

{% include feature_gallery.html id="gallery_seamless" %}

Our solution was to create a tool that analyzes the game data to **regenerate completely new mask textures** from the upscaled background textures. The original mask textures are not used or processed in any way.

<div class="feature__wrapper"></div>

# Frequently Asked Questions

>**The inventory is not upscaled. Is it normal?**<br>
Yes. Replacing RE3's textures using Dolphin happens to be very challenging. We solved most problems but for the items displayed in the inventory and the item box, it's just impossible. The textures dumped by Dolphin are generated on the fly for every inventory combinations possible. We have no way around these billions different textures...
{: .notice }

>**How do I install the pack?**<br>
Our pack comes along a custom version of Dolphin (a Gamecube emulator). All you have to do is to extract the Zip file, open Dolphin.exe, select the folder containing your game ISO, configure the controller if needed and play! **We don't provide the game ISO** and we will not help you to find one. If you can't open the zip file, you might need to download and use [7Zip <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
{: .notice }

>**Is it compatible with the PAL version?**<br>
Yes but the pack was made with the US (NTSC) version in mind. Therefore you need to rename the folder "\*dolphin_path\*\User\Load\Textures\\<wbr>**GLEE08**" to "**GLEP08**". Please note that the texts and some 3d models will not be upscaled.
{: .notice }

>**Can I use the pack on the PC version ?**<br>
Sadly no... As far as we know there is no community patch for RE3 that would potentially allow us to replace the original textures with upscaled ones. 
{: .notice }

>**...and on Dolphin for Mac/Android?**<br>
Yes. But we don't provide a custom version of Dolphin for these platforms. That being said, the source code is available on [Github <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/MoArtis/dolphin) and can be built for these platforms.
{: .notice }

<!-- >**Do I need to download the 2 packs ?**<br>
No, if you just want to play, only the first link is necessary ("Custom Dolphin + RE2SHDP"). The second link is only provided to people who want to have a look at the source files since the playable pack is using optimized DDS files.
{: .notice } -->

>**What can I do if I have hiccups?**<br>
If you are experiencing **noticeable performance hiccups and slowdowns** when the background changes or when you open the inventory, try this on Dolphin: Open the "Graphics" menu, go to the "Advanced" tab and, in the "Utility" section, turn on the the "**Prefetch Custom Textures**" option. You need to restart the game and wait for a bit for the change to take effect. 
{: .notice }

<!-- Please note that this option uses a lot of RAM (~4GB), the game will slow down a lot for a minute and turning on and off the pack -->

>**How to turn off the pack while playing?**<br>
You can turn the pack on and off while playing with the **DELETE** key. Please note that if you have the "**Prefetch Custom Textures**" option activated, the textures will have to be reloaded entirely again.
{: .notice }

>**How to skip the door animations?**<br>
You can't do that in the Gamecube version. But you can hold the **TAB** key to speed up the game at any time.
{: .notice }

>**Can you help me regarding Dolphin?**<br>
Yes. As we modified the emulator, it is better to ask us directly. You will find different ways to contact us just below.
<!-- We only made tiny modifications to the emulator so, if you have any problem or question regarding Dolphin you better off checking their [FAQ <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/) or asking on their [forum <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/). -->

# Customized Dolphin build

Since 2016, RE2 and RE3 on Dolphin, a great open-source Gamecube emulator, suffer from a [music stuttering bug <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://bugs.dolphin-emu.org/issues/9840). 

To ensure the best experience, we created a custom build by modifying a recent version of the emulator. This allows us to distribute our pack using the [BC7 texture format <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d11/bc7-format) ensuring no additional stuttering when the background changes.

Here are the most important modifications:

{% include feature_gallery.html id="gallery_dolphin" %}

As the version is portable, you can use it alongside another install of Dolphin. Its "Users" folder is located next to its executable.

The source code of this custom build is available on [Github <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/MoArtis/dolphin)

# Is it perfect?

No. And we would like to give you more details about the most obvious issues.

![image-left](/img/RE2_perfect/text_issue.jpg){: .align-left}
**Neural networks upscaling is not magic.** The algorithm has an especially hard time with dark areas and RE games are clearly not games with the brightest and the most colorful backgrounds. Expect to see a lot of **"melting" artefacts** on dark corners and distant parts of the backgrounds.<br>
Small texts will also end up being processed as melting garbage. We replaced them when the result was too distracting.

![image-right](/img/RE2_perfect/mask_issue.jpg){: .align-right}
Many original **mask textures don't line up perfectly** with their respective background texture. Thus some pixels which are not part of the foreground appear on top of the 3D models.<br>
These issues are barely noticeable at such low resolution and on a CRT (And the game was intended to be displayed on a CRT like any game of that era).<br>
But these issues can be very distracting at an high resolution and on a flatscreen. We touched up the worst offenders but thousands of man-hours is required to clean up everything.

![image-left](/img/RE2_perfect/vectorization_issue.jpg){: .align-left}
The full process to create this pack is quite complex and involve multiple tools through multiple steps: Game data analysis, PC to GameCube texture matching, analysis of mask special cases, mask alpha layers vectorization, texture upscaling, texture recreation... **Bugs are to be expected** with such process. So even if we carefully tested the pack during development, you will certainly encounter small unexpected issues.

That being said, if you encounter such issues, have any problem with the pack or notice a big imperfection, don't hesitate to report it on [Github Issues <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/MoArtis/ResidentEvilSeamlessHdProject/issues).

Your feedbacks will help us to improve the quality of the pack.

# FMV Pack

RESHDP provides an optional pack which replaces the original interlaced 320x160 FMVs to a new WHOPPING resolution of 640x320...?

Considering the massive size of the pack (1.9 GB), the new resolution might seems oddly small. The main reason is that **we can't replace the actual video files from the disc.** Thus we are replacing their frames as they are displayed by the GPU using a massive amount of texture files. It's extremely wasteful as we can't benefit from any basic video compression technique.

But even with those constrains, we still believe the quality to be noticeably better anyway. Check out our comparison images below and [give it a try yourself](#top). One caveat though: **we do not recommend to use texture prefetching** with the FMV pack as the total amount of memory needed is very high.
